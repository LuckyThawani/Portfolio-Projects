# README: Airflow DAG for Model Selection

## Overview
This project demonstrates an **Apache Airflow DAG** designed to train three models and select the most accurate one based on randomly generated accuracies. The DAG leverages Python and Bash operators to create a workflow where:
1. Three models are trained (simulated with random integers for accuracy).
2. The best model is selected based on accuracy.
3. A final task determines if the best model is "accurate" (accuracy > 8) or "inaccurate."

---

## Key Features
- **DAG Name**: `my_dag`
- **Execution Schedule**: Daily (`@daily`)
- **Tasks**:
  1. **Model Training**: Generates random accuracies for three models.
  2. **Model Selection**: Identifies the best model based on accuracy.
  3. **Result Output**: Prints whether the best model is "accurate" or "inaccurate."

## Code Breakdown

### 1. **Dependencies**
The following Python libraries and Airflow operators are used:
- `datetime`: For defining DAG schedules.
- `random.randint`: Simulates model accuracies.
- `PythonOperator`: Executes Python functions as tasks.
- `BranchPythonOperator`: Determines the workflow path based on logic.
- `BashOperator`: Executes shell commands.

### 2. **Python Functions**
#### `_training_model`
Generates a random accuracy between 1 and 10 for each model.
```python
def _training_model():
    return randint(1,10)
```

#### `_choose_best_model`
Fetches accuracies of all models using `xcom_pull` and selects the best model. If the highest accuracy is greater than 8, it returns `"accurate"`, otherwise `"inaccurate"`.
```python
def _choose_best_model(ti):
    accuracies = ti.xcom_pull(task_ids=['training_model_A', 'training_model_B', 'training_model_C'])
    best_accuracy = max(accuracies)
    return 'accurate' if best_accuracy > 8 else 'inaccurate'
```

### 3. **DAG Definition**
The DAG is named `my_dag` and starts on **January 1, 2025**. It runs daily without backfilling old runs (`catchup=False`).

### 4. **Task Definitions**
- **Training Tasks**: 
  - `training_model_A`
  - `training_model_B`
  - `training_model_C`
  Each uses the `PythonOperator` to execute `_training_model`.

- **Branching Task**:
  - `choose_best_model`:
    Uses `BranchPythonOperator` to decide whether the DAG will proceed to the "accurate" or "inaccurate" task.

- **Output Tasks**:
  - `accurate`:
    Executes a Bash command to print `"accurate"`.
  - `inaccurate`:
    Executes a Bash command to print `"inaccurate"`.

### 5. **Task Dependencies**
The tasks are connected as follows:
- `training_model_A`, `training_model_B`, and `training_model_C` run concurrently.
- After they complete, `choose_best_model` determines the next step.
- Based on the outcome, either `accurate` or `inaccurate` executes.

```python
[training_model_A, training_model_B, training_model_C] >> choose_best_model >> [accurate, inaccurate]
```

## How to Run the DAG

### Prerequisites
1. Install Apache Airflow:
   ```bash
   pip install apache-airflow
   ```
2. Set up an Airflow project and enable the scheduler and web server:
   ```bash
   airflow db init
   airflow scheduler
   airflow webserver
   ```
3. Place the script in the `dags/` directory of your Airflow project.

### Steps
1. Start the Airflow webserver and scheduler.
2. In the Airflow UI, enable the DAG `my_dag`.
3. Monitor the DAG's execution and review logs for each task.

## Example Output
1. **Training Tasks**:
   ```
   Task: training_model_A
   Output: 7
   Task: training_model_B
   Output: 9
   Task: training_model_C
   Output: 6
   ```
2. **Branching Decision**:
   ```
   Task: choose_best_model
   Output: accurate
   ```
3. **Final Task**:
   ```
   Task: accurate
   Output: accurate
   ```
