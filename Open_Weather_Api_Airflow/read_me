ðŸš€ Leveling Up in Data Engineering! ðŸš€

Grateful to have access to incredible learning platforms like Coursera, YouTube, and Udemyâ€”they've truly made my upskilling journey seamless! A few weeks ago, I set out to deepen my expertise in Data Engineering, focusing on Apache Airflow (DAGs) and Amazon Web Services (AWS), including EC2, S3, and Lambda. I'm excited to share that I recently completed a project under the digital mentorship of TupleSpectra, where I put my learnings into action.

Here are some key takeaways from my project:

ðŸ”¹ Data Extraction via APIs â€“ Integrated data pipelines using OpenWeather API for real-time weather data. (Had my eye on Twitterâ€™s API too, but thanks to the Musk takeover, it became a paid serviceâ€”so, pivoted accordingly! ðŸ˜†)

ðŸ”¹ Apache Airflow Workflow Automation â€“ Explored Airflow's core functionalities and hands-on experience with operators like PythonOperator, BashOperator, and HttpOperator.

ðŸ”¹ AWS EC2 with Auto-Scaling â€“ Configured EC2 instances with automatic scaling to efficiently manage fluctuating workloads.

ðŸ”¹ AWS IAM & S3 â€“ Created and managed IAM roles and S3 Buckets for secure and structured data storage.

ðŸ”¹ AWS Lambda & Event-Driven Architecture â€“ Scheduled a daily Apache Airflow DAG to load data into S3, then leveraged AWS Lambda triggers to detect new CSV files and execute a Python script for incremental updates on weather trends.

This journey took me just 30 focused minutes a day over the last two weeksâ€”a slow but deliberate learning process to grasp every detail. And it was absolutely worth it! ðŸ’¡

The world of Data Engineering is vast, and this is just the beginning! Looking forward to more hands-on projects and deeper dives into cloud technologies.
