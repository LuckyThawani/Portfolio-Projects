# Kafka Producer & Consumer with AWS S3 Integration

## Overview
This repository contains Python scripts for implementing a Kafka Producer and Consumer. The producer reads data from a CSV file and sends messages to a Kafka topic, while the consumer listens for messages and stores them in an AWS S3 bucket.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.9
- Kafka setup and running on a server (Please check the Initial Terminal Setup file in the repository for the configuration)
- AWS credentials configured for accessing S3
- Required Python packages:
  ```bash
  pip install kafka-python pandas s3fs
  ```

## File Descriptions
- **KafkaProducer.py**: Reads data from a CSV file and publishes messages to a Kafka topic.
- **KafkaConsumer.py**: Consumes messages from Kafka and stores them in an AWS S3 bucket.

## Setup Instructions
### 1. Start Kafka and Zookeeper
Ensure Kafka and Zookeeper are running before executing the scripts.
```bash
bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties &
bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties &
```

### 2. Create a Kafka Topic
```bash
bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --topic demo_testing2 --bootstrap-server <BROKER_IP>:9092 --partitions 1 --replication-factor 1
```

### 3. Run the Producer
Modify the CSV file path in `KafkaProducer.py` if necessary, then execute:
```bash
python KafkaProducer.py
```

### 4. Run the Consumer
Modify the AWS S3 bucket details in `KafkaConsumer.py`, then execute:
```bash
python KafkaConsumer.py
```

## Configuration Details
- **KafkaProducer.py**
  - Reads stock market data from a CSV file
  - Sends messages to the Kafka topic `demo_testing2`
- **KafkaConsumer.py**
  - Listens to the Kafka topic `demo_testing2`
  - Stores received messages as JSON files in an AWS S3 bucket

## AWS S3 Integration
Ensure AWS credentials are configured properly to allow access to the S3 bucket. Modify the bucket name in `KafkaConsumer.py` to match your setup.

## Stopping Kafka and Zookeeper
To stop Kafka and Zookeeper, use:
```bash
bin/kafka-server-stop.sh
bin/zookeeper-server-stop.sh
```
